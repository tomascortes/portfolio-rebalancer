# Code style
- Dont follow CLEAN codea as a bible, consider legebility over specific rules
- dont use comments unless there is a weird hacky line. And the comment should explain the why, not the what
# Workflow
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Follow commit standar of "type(scope): description"
